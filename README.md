# Project - SHA256

## Overview:
A hash function takes an arbitrary-length message input to produce a fixed-length output. This project aims at implementing an hardware accelerator peripheral for SHA256 hashing algorithm with AXI4 interfacing with PicoRV32 CPU. The project focuses on multiple implementations of the accelerator with gradual improvements through spatial pre-computation techniques and pipelining. The SHA256 accelerators are implemented using Verilog and synthesized using Yosys Open Synthesis Suite. The optimized designs are then compared with a base-line C implementation in software.   Hash functions are used to securely store passwords, to quickly store and retrive data, and also to check if a file/message is corrupted.

## Introduction:

The SHA family of hash function algorithms are used during data transmission to produce an indecipherable message digest. A hash function is a one-way deterministic function which is practically infeasible to invert a hash value to its message input. Therefore, it becomes an essential tool for embedded security in e-mail, internet banking, and other applications. The strong motivation behind this project is that these applications especially on the server-side require high-throughput low-latent encryption devices.

### Key Highlights of SHA256 Hashing:

1. The hashing is deterministic (i.e the data is scrambled deterministically)
2. Irrespective of the size of input, the output of the hashing process is always 256-bits long.
3. The original data cannot be retrived from the scrambled data as it is a one-way function.

## Algorithm:

The general architecture of the SHA256 hashing algorithm consists of following modules: 
 - **Padding and Parsing:** that ensures that the input message has length of multiples of 512 bits.

 - **Message Expansion:** that decomposes the input message into 16 blocks of 32 bits each and further expands it into 64 blocks `{W}`

- **Block Compression:**  that iterates 64 times on 8 - 32 bit variables `{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}` using {W} values obtained from previous stage and constants `{K}` 

- **Hash Value Computation:** that utilizes the 8 variables to generate a concatenated 256 bit output  

#### Basic Operations:
- `RotR(A, n)` denotes the circular right shift of n bits of the binary word A.
- `ShR(A, n)` denotes the right shift of n bits of the binary word A.
- `A||B` denotes the concatenation of the binary words A and B.

#### Functions:
We use the following functions in our algorithm:
- ***Ch(X, Y, Z)** = (X ∧ Y ) ⊕ (X ∧ Z),*
- ***Maj(X, Y, Z)** = (X ∧ Y ) ⊕ (X ∧ Z) ⊕ (Y ∧ Z)*
- ***Σ_0(X)** = RotR(X, 2) ⊕ RotR(X, 13) ⊕ RotR(X, 22),*
- ***Σ_1(X)** = RotR(X, 6) ⊕ RotR(X, 11) ⊕ RotR(X, 25),*
- ***σ_0(X)** = RotR(X, 7) ⊕ RotR(X, 18) ⊕ ShR(X, 3),*
- ***σ_1(X)** = RotR(X, 17) ⊕ RotR(X, 19) ⊕ ShR(X, 10),*

64 binary words of `K[i]` are given by the first 4 bytes of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers:

### Padding:
This step is to make the the padded message become 512 bits. This step can be done in software becuase as per our analysis the bottleneck is not in this step. Therefore this step needs to be implemented in software.
- The input message is converted to bits
- `1` is appended to this message
- Now, `0`'s are appended till 448^th bit (= 512-64)
- Then the length of the input message is calculated and is appended to the end of this 448 bit long value in 64 bits format to make the entire input into 512 bits.

This new 512 bit padded input is used for further processing from here on. However for our use case we assume that we have the padded message ready, as we faced some problem while implementing the code for pre-processing.

### Block Compression:

For each block `M ∈ {0, 1} 512` , 64 words of 32 bits each are constructed as follows:
1. The first 16 are obtained by splitting M in 32-bit blocks
    **Message = W1||W2|| · · · ||W15||W16**

2. The remaining 48 are obtained with the formula:
    **Wi = σ_1(Wi−2) + Wi−7 + σ_0(Wi−15) + Wi−16**, where *17 ≤ i ≤ 64.*

### Hash Value Computation:

First, eight variables are set to their initial values, given by the first 32 bits of the fractional part of the square roots of the first 8 prime numbers:

        H1(0) = 0x6a09e667     
        H2(0) = 0xbb67ae85     
        H3(0)= 0x3c6ef372     
        H4(0) = 0xa54ff53a
        H5(0) = 0x510e527f     
        H6(0) = 0x9b05688c     
        H7(0) = 0x1f83d9ab     
        H8(0) = 0x5be0cd19

Next, the blocks M(1) , M(2), . . . , M(N) are processed one at a time:

    For t = 1 to N construct the 64 blocks Wi from M(t) , as explained above

Now set:
`(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) = (H 1 (t−1) , H 2 (t−1) , H 3 (t−1) , H 4 (t−1) , H 5 (t−1) , H 6 (t−1) , H 7 (t−1) , H 8 (t−1) )`

Do 64 rounds consisting of:

        T1 = h + Σ_1(e) + Ch(e, f, g) + Ki + Wi
        T2 = Σ_0(a) + M aj(a, b, c)

        h = g
        g = f
        f = e
        e = d + T1
        d = c
        c = b
        b = a
        a = T1 + T2

Now computing the new value of `Hj(t)` as follows:

        H1(t) = H1(t-1) + a
        H2(t) = H2(t-1) + b
        H3(t) = H3(t-1) + c
        H4(t) = H4(t-1) + d
        H5(t) = H5(t-1) + e
        H6(t) = H6(t-1) + f
        H7(t) = H7(t-1) + g
        H8(t) = H8(t-1) + h

The hash of the message is the concatenation of the variables Hi after the last block has been processed as follows:

    H = H1(N) || H2(N) || H3(N) || H4(N) || H5(N) || H6(N) || H7(N) || H8(N) .

## Execution of the Code:

There are three main directories. Namely:

1. SHACORE
2. SHACORE\_UNROLLED
3. SHACORE\_UNROLLED\_PIPELINED

As their names suggest each of these folders contain a different implementation of the SHA256 Peripheral.

#### **SHACORE:**
To move into this folder use `$ cd SHACORE`

This folder contains the implementation of the original un-optimsed (without any spatial optimisation or pipelining) verilog code. The `sha256_core.v`file contains the verilog implementation of the accelerator.

To execute and see the peripheral inaction use the `$ make` command.

To run the Yosys synthesis and also to execute the generated file simultaneously, use the '$ ./run.sh' command. If the `$ ./run.sh` didn't work, use `chmod +x run.sh` followed by `$ ./run.sh`. Once this is done, you will be able to see the synthesis results in the command prompt. To view the complete file, use `$ ./run.sh > output.log`. This will store the entire output in the *output.log* file.

#### **SHACORE-UNROLLED:**
To move into this folder use `$ cd SHACORE_UNROLLED`

This folder contains the implementation of the original spatially optimised verilog code. The `sha256_unrolled.v`file contains the verilog implementation of the accelerator. Further details about unrolling (which is a form of spacial optimisation) is given in the following section.

To execute and see the peripheral inaction use the `$ make` command.

To run the Yosys synthesis and also to execute the generated file simultaneously, use the '$ ./run.sh' command. If the `$ ./run.sh` didn't work, use `chmod +x run.sh` followed by `$ ./run.sh`. Once this is done, you will be able to see the synthesis results in the command prompt. To view the complete file, use `$ ./run.sh > output.log`. This will store the entire output in the *output.log* file.

#### **SHACORE-UNROLLED-PIPELINED:**
To move into this folder use `$ cd SHACORE_UNROLLED_PIPELINED`

This folder contains the implementation of the optimised verilog code, which contains both unrolling and pipelining. The `sha256_unrolled_pipelined.v`file contains the verilog implementation of the accelerator. Further details about this unrolled and pipelined accelerator architecture is given in the following section.

To execute and see the peripheral inaction use the `$ make` command.

To run the Yosys synthesis and also to execute the generated file simultaneously, use the '$ ./run.sh' command. If the `$ ./run.sh` didn't work, use `chmod +x run.sh` followed by `$ ./run.sh`. Once this is done, you will be able to see the synthesis results in the command prompt. To view the complete file, use `$ ./run.sh > output.log`. This will store the entire output in the *output.log* file.
